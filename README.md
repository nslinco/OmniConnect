# OmniConnect
A dApp for structuring digital assets

## Motivation
With the fairly recent explosion of interest in digital asset ownership, the scramble of crypto marketplaces like OpenSea and SuperRare to create lasting metadata standards made the need for a digital asset organization platform blindingly apparent. Furthermore, many assets are being sold under the assumption that they will be usable within a blockchain-integrated digital 'metaverse'. Just like social media interfaces like MySpace and Facebook fade in and out of existence, interfaces for the idea of the metaverse will come and go, but the immutable nature of the blockchain on which these digital assets are stored creates a unique opportunity to build an underlying framework for structuring digital assets around which metaverse interfaces will compete through the rendering of and interaction with those digital goods.

Here's the gist:

Currently, digital assets such as NFTs exist only as an entry in the list of digital goods connected to the wallets of their owners. So what happens when someone has two avatars? They can pay to create an additional asset for their wallet that designates which avatar they want to use for each metaverse interface, or they can save their money and let every metaverse interface individually ask them which avatar they would like to use. Now scale this problem up to the structure of furniture and art in a digital home, or the parts and accessories for a digital car, it gets very messy very quickly especially when considering that people may want to tune the structure of their home or vehicle according to the strengths and weaknesses of their preferred metaverse interfaces.

## Summary
OmniConnect solves the problem of structuring digital assets and versioning those structures accross many different interfaces by providing a fully on-chain Dapp which allows users to structure their digital assets hierarchically using powerful JSON-based formats such as glTF for 3D objects/environments. Furthermore, Polygon's PoS layer 2 solution is used to reduce transaction fees to negligible rates compared to any Ethereum mainnet solution.

Because OmniConnect exists entirely on-chain as a set of smart contracts, users only ever interact with it by proxy through their current 'metaverse' interface. Additionally, a user can modify their asset structures for every interface from any single interface. To put this into perspective by extending the social media analogy, imagine the 'metaverse' as a central collection of everyone's social media posts across every site from their YouTube videos to their tweets. Just as Twitter has cornered a section of public dialogue through streamlining online discussions and YouTube has cornered a section of entertainment by using 'the algorithm' as a reccommendation powerhouse, different metaverse interfaces will fight to fill niches such as high degrees of user interaction or accurate vehicle physics as they arise. However, this is as far as the social media analogy can take us because if you wanted to follow a new musician that you like on social media, you would either have to follow them separately on every form of social media or rely on them to point you towards the relevant platform at any given time. OmniConnect allows users to update only a single structure, call it "My Favorite Musicians" which is visibe to and referenced by all blockchain-integrated metaverse interfaces.

## Stack
-     Frontend: ReactJS (cloud-hosted using Google's Firebase)
-     Blockchain: Ethereum Testnet (Solidity Smart Contracts)
-     Testing: Hardhat & Remix

## Next Steps
1. Publish Smart Contracts
2. I have a few different asset structure vizualization tools that I want to gauge user interest in
3. Full-stack example from an NFT marketplace -> OmniConnect -> 'metaverse'
